        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 cups finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p></li>
            <li><p>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p></li>
        </ol>
